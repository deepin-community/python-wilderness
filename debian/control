Description: Light wrapper around argparse for creating command line applications
 Wilderness is a light wrapper around argparse for creating command line
 applications with multiple subcommands, in the style of Git. Wilderness also
 makes it easy to generate man pages for your application.
 .
 Wilderness is heavily inspired by Cleo and argparse-manpage, but aims to stick
 as closely as possible to argparse to avoid users having to learn a new API.
